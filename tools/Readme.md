# Here are some additionnal tools that help me working with SuperTruder

## Addthis
Adds something you give to the bottom of a list; I use it for updating my wordlists with the endpoints I find.
`./addthis <wordlist> what1 what2 what3 [....] what12134384 `

## Combinethem
Use it to combile wordlist A with B into wordlist C; Adds each entry of B to each entry of A and saves it in C.
I use it when I want to test a list of endpoints on a list of hosts with SuperTruder.
`./combinethem A B C <caracter between A & B or blank>`
